PaysonCheckout 2.0
Payson offers a simple way to receive payments from your customers using Visa, MasterCard, Direct bank transfer and WyWallet with one contract. You may additionally apply for the Payson Invoice service to give Swedish customers the opportunity to pay later and in installments as Payson will handle the whole process of credit checks, invoice delivery, reminders, etc. Payments can be processed in SEK and EUR and the services are available in Swedish, Finnish and English. Each transaction will be registered to your Payson account immediately and you may withdraw the funds in your Payson account balance to your bank account at any time for a small charge.

There are currently two versions of the PaysonCheckout available, the first (1.0) will let the customer choose payment method with corresponding buttons and can be modified with the payment methods you decide. The second one (2.0) will also manage the customer address and will present the quickest payment option for that customer. This version requires all payment methods to be enabled with Payson.

For more information please contact Payson or look to the Payson Terms / Agreement.
